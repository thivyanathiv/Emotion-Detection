Project: Emotion Detection Using Teachable Machine
Description:
This project is a web-based application that uses machine learning to detect and classify human emotions in real-time through a webcam. The application leverages Google's Teachable Machine and TensorFlow.js to perform image-based emotion recognition.
Key Features:
1.	Webcam Integration: Captures live video feed for real-time emotion detection.
2.	Teachable Machine Model: A pre-trained model is used for recognizing emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.
3.	Timer-Based Detection: Allows users to set a detection duration and displays the dominant emotion based on the highest average score during the detection period.
4.	Real-Time Feedback: Shows live probability percentages for each detected emotion.
5.	User-Friendly Interface: Simple buttons for starting and resetting the detection process.
Technologies Used:
•	HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For the frontend and application logic.
•	TensorFlow.js: For running the machine learning model in the browser.
•	Teachable Machine: For training the emotion recognition model.
Challenges Overcome:
•	Integrating the Teachable Machine model into a custom web interface.
•	Handling real-time webcam video feed with accurate frame-by-frame predictions.
•	Designing a user-friendly interface for non-technical users.
Outcome:
The project successfully detects emotions and provides an average emotion score, making it a potential tool for applications in mental health monitoring, user feedback systems, and human-computer interaction.
This project demonstrates skills in machine learning integration, web development, and real-time data processing.
